I'm a Computer Science Ph.D. student at Princeton University.

I am fascinated by the interplay between machine learning, graphical models, causal inference, and computer vision. Recently I've been thinking about
* How generative machine learning models such as VAEs and GANs can be integrated into causal inference to solve latent confounding.
* How methods of graphical models can be incorporated into fair machine learning. 
* Large scale causal inference on time series datasets using representation learning algorithms.
